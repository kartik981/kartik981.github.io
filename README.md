# üëã About Me
I am a **Data Analyst** with a passion for uncovering insights from data to drive business decisions. With expertise in **data cleaning, visualization, predictive modeling, and automation**, I specialize in using **Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning** to analyze and interpret complex datasets. My goal is to translate data into actionable insights that help businesses optimize their strategies and improve efficiency.
Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**, where I showcase my projects that utilize **data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and business insights** to solve real-world problems. These projects highlight my proficiency in **Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning algorithms** to derive data-driven decisions. Below are the projects I have worked on:

# üöÄ Projects

## üìä [Market Segmentation for a Chain Restaurant](https://github.com/kartik981/Market-Segmentation-Project)
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** to assist a restaurant in identifying the best target audience for their expansion. Using **hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering**, I analyzed a dataset containing **1,000 customer records** with demographic and behavioral attributes. The optimal number of **five customer segments** was determined through **elbow method analysis**, each group exhibiting distinct purchasing patterns and brand preferences. **Tableau dashboards** were developed to visualize **demographics, spending habits, and psychographics**, providing actionable insights for **personalized marketing and store location selection**.

## üíª Finding Key Factors Affecting Customer Decisions (Conjoint Analysis)
This study uses **conjoint analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to determine the key attributes influencing **laptop purchasing decisions**. The dataset originally had **576 possible product profiles**, which were reduced to **20 optimized profiles** using **fractional factorial design**. The study examined **five main product attributes (Brand, Hard Drive, RAM, Screen Size, and Price)**. Results showed that **RAM (25%) and Screen Size (25.85%)** were the most influential attributes. A **market simulation using a First Choice Model and Logit Share Model** predicted that **Apple laptops dominated the market with 37% preference**, while Dell had zero market share. These insights can be used to **optimize pricing, product features, and marketing strategies**.

## üê¶ Twitter Sentiment Analysis & Like Prediction
This project performs **sentiment analysis and engagement prediction** on **Donald Trump‚Äôs tweets** to examine public perception and predict tweet popularity. The dataset includes **40,000 tweets** from **2014 to 2020**, analyzed using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Sentiment analysis was conducted using **VADER and TextBlob**, categorizing tweets into **positive, neutral, and negative sentiments**. **Machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes)** were used to predict tweet likes, with **Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 72.61%**. The analysis revealed that **controversial and patriotic tweets, such as those mentioning "Make America Great Again," had the highest engagement levels**, providing insights into **social media strategy and political communication**.

## ‚òï Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel
Developed a **dynamic and interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel** to analyze sales performance across **different coffee types, regions, and customer preferences**. The dataset contained **50,000 sales transactions** with attributes such as **order date, customer ID, product type, quantity sold, and pricing**. Using **Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timelines**, the dashboard allows users to filter data dynamically. Key insights include **sales trends over time, top customers, and regional performance**. **XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH** were used for efficient data retrieval, while **custom formatting and interactive elements** improved usability. This project demonstrates expertise in **Excel-based data visualization, automation, and business intelligence**.
