## üìä [Market Segmentation for a Chain Restaurant](https://github.com/kartik981/Market-Segmentation-Project)
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** to assist a restaurant in identifying the best target audience for their expansion. Using **hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering**, I analyzed a dataset containing **1,000 customer records** with demographic and behavioral attributes. The optimal number of **five customer segments** was determined through **elbow method analysis**, each group exhibiting distinct purchasing patterns and brand preferences. **Tableau dashboards** were developed to visualize **demographics, spending habits, and psychographics**, providing actionable insights for **personalized marketing and store location selection**.

## üíª [Finding Key Factors Affecting Customer Decisions (Conjoint Analysis)](https://github.com/kartik981/Conjoint-Analysis-to-predict-CustomerDecisions)
This study uses **conjoint analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to determine the key attributes influencing **laptop purchasing decisions**. The dataset originally had **576 possible product profiles**, which were reduced to **20 optimized profiles** using **fractional factorial design**. The study examined **five main product attributes (Brand, Hard Drive, RAM, Screen Size, and Price)**. Results showed that **RAM (25%) and Screen Size (25.85%)** were the most influential attributes. A **market simulation using a First Choice Model and Logit Share Model** predicted that **Apple laptops dominated the market with 37% preference**, while Dell had zero market share. These insights can be used to **optimize pricing, product features, and marketing strategies**.

## üê¶ [Twitter Sentiment Analysis & Like Prediction](https://github.com/kartik981/Twitter-Text-Mining-for-Sentiment-Analysis-)
This project performs **sentiment analysis and engagement prediction** on **Donald Trump‚Äôs tweets** to examine public perception and predict tweet popularity. The dataset includes **40,000 tweets** from **2014 to 2020**, analyzed using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Sentiment analysis was conducted using **VADER and TextBlob**, categorizing tweets into **positive, neutral, and negative sentiments**. **Machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Na√Øve Bayes)** were used to predict tweet likes, with **Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 72.61%**. The analysis revealed that **controversial and patriotic tweets, such as those mentioning "Make America Great Again," had the highest engagement levels**, providing insights into **social media strategy and political communication**.

The dataset contained **50,000 sales transactions** with attributes such as **order date, customer ID, product type, quantity sold, and pricing**. Using **Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timelines**, the dashboard allows users to filter data dynamically. Key insights include **sales trends over time, top customers, and regional performance**. **XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH** were used for efficient data retrieval, while **custom formatting and interactive elements** improved usability. This project demonstrates expertise in **Excel-based data visualization, automation, and business intelligence**.
